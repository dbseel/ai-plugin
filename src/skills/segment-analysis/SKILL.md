# Noibu Segment Conversion Analysis

This skill has two entry points. Read the prompt carefully before doing anything.

## Quick answer — focused question

If the user asked a specific, focused question ("which channel converts best?",
"how does mobile compare to desktop?", "which countries are underperforming?"):

1. Run only the one or two queries needed to answer it.
2. Give a short, direct answer — a few sentences and a small table if useful.
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` — not prose — to offer the full analysis. The tool
   renders a choice UI the user can act on; prose questions get skipped.

   Question: "Want me to run a full segment analysis?"
   Options:
    - "Yes — survey device, country, and channel, then dig into anomalies"
    - "No thanks"

   If they select yes, proceed to Full analysis.

## Full analysis

If the user asked for a broad analysis or said yes to the quick-answer offer,
run the two-part workflow below.

---

## Step 0: Authenticate

If Noibu tools (`noibu_search_sessions` etc.) are not yet available in the
session, ask the user to authenticate first. Once they do, the tools appear
automatically.

## Step 1: Resolve the domain

- **UUID provided**: use it directly.
- **Name provided**: call `noibu_get_domain`.
    - Match found → use the UUID.
    - No match but suggestions returned in error body (e.g.
      `["www.brand.com", "www.brand.ca"]`) → show the suggestions and ask which
      to use. Do not fall through to `noibu_list_domains` when suggestions exist.
    - No match, no suggestions → fall back to `noibu_list_domains`.
- **Nothing provided**: call `noibu_list_domains` and ask the user to select.

## Step 2: Determine the date range

Default to the last 30 days unless the user specifies otherwise. Construct
`startTime` / `endTime` as ISO 8601 UTC strings.

---

## Broad segment overview

Tell the user what's happening before queries run — something like:
"Starting with a high-level look across your key segments — device, country,
and marketing channel — to see where conversion stands and spot anything
worth investigating further."

Fire all three queries in a single turn — do not wait for one before launching
the next. Also call `noibu_context` in this same turn if you haven't already.

**Do not apply minimum session thresholds at this stage.** See the full picture
first; you'll calibrate thresholds when running follow-ups.

**Note on field discovery:** The descriptions below explain what each query
should measure conceptually. Use `noibu_context` or the API schema to confirm
the current field names before running. Do not guess field names.

### Device breakdown
Use `noibu_search_sessions`. Group by the field representing device type. Measure
session count, conversion rate, and revenue per session. Order by conversion
rate descending.

### Country breakdown
Use `noibu_search_sessions`. Group by the field representing country (limit 30).
Measure session count, conversion rate, and revenue per session. Order by
sessions descending.

Order by sessions (not CVR) so the highest-traffic markets appear first —
easier to spot high-volume underperformers.

### Marketing channel breakdown
Use `noibu_search_sessions`. Group by the fields representing UTM source and UTM
medium together (limit 30). Measure session count, conversion rate, and revenue
per session. Order by sessions descending.

Same rationale — order by sessions to surface the channels carrying the most
weight, then assess their conversion rate.

---

## Reviewing the broad overview — finding what to dig into

After the queries return, do not immediately render a full dashboard. **Compute
the site-wide conversion rate** from this data (total sessions ÷ total purchases
across all segments) and use it as the benchmark for calling out segments that
are notably over- or under-performing.

Identify the 2–4 most interesting signals using the diagnostic playbook below.
Follow-up queries are not predetermined — they depend on what the data shows.

| If you see this... | Consider this follow-up |
|---|---|
| A high-traffic country with conversion well below the site average | Break down by landing page — look for a localized or campaign-specific page that might have friction |
| A country with near-zero conversion | Break down by landing page filtered to that country, or check if a campaign is sending traffic to a broken page |
| A paid social channel with high traffic share but very low conversion | Break down by individual campaign to find which ones are dragging the channel down |
| One channel converting 5–10x better than others | Go deeper on that channel — by campaign or source — to find opportunities to scale it |
| Mobile conversion notably lower than desktop (or vice versa) | Break down by funnel stage and device — to find where specifically shoppers are dropping off |
| A large share of sessions with no channel attribution | Look at landing pages or referral sources to understand what's driving untagged traffic |
| Revenue per session and conversion rate moving in opposite directions for a segment | Flag as likely a currency or order value difference — may not need a follow-up query |

### Displaying the broad overview results

Present the results in a clean, scannable format — one section per dimension
(device, country, channel). For each:
- Show a simple table with plain column headers: Sessions, Conversion Rate,
  Revenue per Session. Avoid internal field names in any user-facing label.
- Add a brief one-sentence callout. Name the specific segment and number
  ("Canada at 0.18% conversion is well below your 2.1% site average"), then
  state the implication ("this points to a landing page or checkout issue, not
  a targeting problem"). Avoid generic observations the user could read off the
  table themselves. Use plain language — no technical field names or jargon.
- Flag any data quality issues simply: untagged traffic, near-zero conversion
  on obvious awareness channels, or currencies that look like local values
  rather than USD.

### Transitioning to the deeper analysis

Write a short, plain-language message that:
1. Summarises what the overview found in 2–3 sentences — reference the actual
   numbers and segment names from the data, not generic descriptions
2. Names what you're going to investigate next and explains *why* each one is
   worth digging into, connected directly to what the overview showed

It should read like a colleague saying: "Canada's conversion is at 0.3% versus
your 2.1% site average, so I'm going to look at which landing pages that traffic
is hitting — that's usually where the friction shows up." Not: "Proceeding to
Phase 2 deeper analysis."

Then either:
- **Auto-run** the follow-ups (preferred when the user's original prompt was
  broad and open-ended)
- **Ask first** if the proposed follow-ups are a significant departure from
  what they asked

---

## Deeper follow-up analysis

Run only the follow-up queries identified above — not a fixed set.

**Apply traffic thresholds now, calibrated to this store's volume:**
- Very high traffic (>500K sessions/month): threshold ~0.1–0.2% of total
- Mid-traffic (50K–500K): threshold ~0.3–0.5% of total
- Lower traffic (<50K): keep thresholds very low or skip them entirely

**Campaign breakdown** — when one channel's aggregate conversion rate hides
variation between individual campaigns within it. Use `noibu_search_sessions`,
grouped by UTM campaign and UTM medium together (limit 25). Order by sessions
descending. Apply the same measures as the broad overview (session count, CVR,
revenue per session).

**Landing page breakdown** — when a country or campaign seems to have friction
at the entry point. Use `noibu_search_sessions`, grouped by the landing URL field
(limit 25). Order by sessions descending. Filter to the relevant country or
campaign from the broad overview to keep results focused.

**Funnel stage breakdown** — when you want to know *where* in the checkout
a segment drops off. Use `noibu_search_sessions`, grouped by funnel depth and one
additional dimension (device type, country, or UTM medium — whichever the
overview flagged). Order by sessions descending. Choose the second dimension
based on what the overview showed; computing step-to-step rates by segment
reveals exactly where friction is highest.

After the query returns, decide based on segment count:

- **One segment** (e.g. only mobile is being investigated): render the funnel as
  an inline bar chart — load `../noibu-context/references/funnel-visualization.md`
  and follow its workflow. Pass four steps: Add to cart (depth ≥ 1) → Checkout
  started (depth ≥ 2) → Payment submitted (depth ≥ 3) → Completed (depth = 4),
  scoped to the focal segment. Call `show_widget` with `title: "<segment>_funnel"`
  (e.g. `mobile_funnel`).
- **Two segments** (e.g. mobile vs desktop): call the reference twice, once per
  segment, and render stacked. Do not encode the comparison via the reference's
  `delta` field — that field is for time-period comparison and would muddy a
  segment-vs-segment read.
- **Three or more segments**: stay on the table. The chart format does not
  generalise to N parallel funnels.

## Rendering the final report

**Structure:**
1. **Key Findings & Recommended Actions** — Write this section after both phases
   are complete — it should synthesize everything, including deeper analysis
   discoveries. Lead with 3–5 numbered finding + action pairs, ordered by impact.
   Every finding must name a specific segment and a concrete number. Every action
   must be specific enough to hand off. No tables in this section.
2. **Segment overview** — one card per dimension (device, country, channel),
   each with a data table and a specific insight callout.
3. **Evidence from deeper analysis** — This section exists to show why the
   actions in Key Findings are warranted — not to restate them. Each card is
   the evidence trail for a finding already summarized above. Do not repeat the
   finding or the action here.

---

## Data quality notes

- **Currency anomalies**: Very high revenue per session for a single country
  usually means local currency, not USD. Flag it rather than presenting it
  at face value.
- **Untagged traffic**: A large share of sessions with no channel attribution
  is a tracking gap worth noting explicitly.
- **Awareness campaigns at zero conversion**: Expected — but still worth
  calling out so the user can confirm the campaign objective is non-conversion.
- **Express checkout on mobile**: More completed purchases than payment page
  views is normal — Apple Pay and Shop Pay bypass the payment step. Explain
  it rather than treating it as a data error.

---

## After the report: saving and scheduling

### Step 1 — Ask if they'd like to save the report and if so how

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- **"Save as a live dashboard"** — a persistent artifact in Cowork that can
  be reopened and refreshed with current data at any time
- **"Save as a PDF"** — a static snapshot they can share or file away
- **"No thanks"**

---

**If they choose live dashboard:**

Do NOT save the already-rendered `show_widget` HTML — that HTML has data baked
in and will appear empty when the artifact is reopened.

Instead, build a brand-new dynamic artifact using `create_artifact`. The artifact
must fetch its own data every time it opens.

**Important:** Use the exact field names that were confirmed to work during the
broad overview queries earlier in this session — do not hardcode or guess field
names. The correct names will already be known from the successful queries above.

1. **Embed config at the top as JS constants:**
   ```js
   const DOMAIN_ID = "...";
   const START_TIME = "...";
   const END_TIME = "...";
   ```

2. **On page load**, call `window.cowork.callMcpTool()` for the three broad
   overview queries (device breakdown, country breakdown, channel breakdown),
   plus any follow-up queries that were run during the session. Use the exact
   same field names and parameters that produced results during the analysis —
   copy them directly from the working queries above.

   **Critical implementation details:**

    - `callMcpTool()` requires the **fully-qualified** tool name — the same
      `mcp__<server>__<tool>` string used in the `mcp_tools` allowlist. The
      short name (e.g. `"noibu_search_sessions"`) will be rejected. Store it as
      a constant: `const TOOL = "mcp__fcde485d-....__noibu_search_sessions";`

    - `callMcpTool()` returns a content-wrapped object, not a plain parsed
      response. Parse records like this:
      ```js
      function records(res) {
        try {
          let obj = res;
          if (typeof res === "string") obj = JSON.parse(res);
          if (obj && obj.content) {
            const text = Array.isArray(obj.content)
              ? obj.content[0].text : obj.content;
            obj = typeof text === "string" ? JSON.parse(text) : text;
          }
          return obj.data.domain.explorationsQueryV2.records;
        } catch(e) { return []; }
      }
      ```

3. **After all fetches resolve**, call `window.cowork.askClaude()` to generate
   insight callouts. **Embed the data directly in the prompt string** — do NOT
   rely on the second `data[]` parameter:
   ```js
   window.cowork.askClaude(
     `In one sentence, what is the key finding? Data: ${JSON.stringify(rows)}`,
     []
   )
   ```
   The return value may be a string or an object — coerce it before use:
   ```js
   function toStr(v) {
     if (typeof v === "string") return v;
     if (v && typeof v === "object")
       return v.text || v.content || v.message || JSON.stringify(v);
     return String(v ?? "");
   }
   ```

4. **Render** using the same visual structure and styling tokens as the
   in-session report.

List all Noibu tool names used in the `mcp_tools` array of `create_artifact`.

**If they choose PDF:**

Before invoking the `pdf` skill, generate a **print-optimized HTML version**
of the report. Web fonts (Inter, IBM Plex Mono) do not load reliably in the
PDF renderer, causing garbled or missing text.

Write this simplified HTML to a temp file, then pass it to the `pdf` skill.
